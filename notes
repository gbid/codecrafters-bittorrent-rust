TODO:
	Error handling	
		Results/unwraps
		Bittorrent protocol failures


Bittorrent protocol failures:
	Tracker is single point of failure => no way to recover => just fail in get_tracker
	Peers are redundant	
		Request Queue with every Piece
			Pick Peers in Round-Robin order
			Reinsert upon download failure from Peer
			Simultaneously request up to 5 pieces
				max 1 request/peer or > 1?
			Implementation details:
				What to use as Queue in Rust?
				max 1 request/peer or > 1: multiple TCP connections per peer possible?

												main
	          network
